# Testgen

## About
This is meant to be a tool for generating basic math tests. Currently, I'm developing it for simple algebra problems, but more advanced material may be added in the future. Additionally, this software will be able to construct accompanying answer keys as well as generate pseudorandom, or individualized tests.

## Future Features
1.  Regenerate problems to "shuffle" elements around. (e.g. "ax + b = c" becomes "b - c = -ax")
2.  Generate random values for problems when given a range of values.
3.  Create method for checking if two problems are equal (even if they're of different form).
4.  Develop parser of declaration to find individual elements of a problem (e.g. Linear eq has "ax", "b", "c"). Must handle signs!
5.  Create a catchall option (or flag) that prevents leading negatives from appearing in a generated or shuffled problem (if possible).

## Bugs
None yet. (But those rascals are probably out there!)
